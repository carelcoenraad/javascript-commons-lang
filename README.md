# JavaScript Commons Lang

A library that is inspired by Apache Commons Lang for Java.

## Principles

- Each function should be documented (including code examples)
- Each function should be unit tested
- Support for ES5
- Support for tree-shaking
- The library is open source
- The library has zero dependencies
- Written based on the latest ES specification

## Sections

- Array Utils
- Boolean Utils
- Object Utils
- Random Utils
- String Utils
- Test Utils

## TODO

- Research license (e.g. commons)
- Research `package.json` meta information (main, module, es2015, types, etc.)
- Research how major libraries such as Angular, React, and Vue handle this (e.g. Mocha has its own [utils](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/blob/master/lib/utils.js#L52))
- Research TypeScript support
- Setup JavaScript docs
- Setup project governance document

## Development Prerequisites

- Node v10.8.0 or later
- NPM
